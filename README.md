# Prework Environment Checker

Now that you've completed your [First Lab](http://learn.flatironschool.com/lessons/1013), we're going to make sure that you've installed everything okay when you configured your environment back in [Environment Setup](http://learn.flatironschool.com/lessons/1171).

All you need to do is run `ironboard`, which will run the tests in the `spec/` directory. Don't worry if running the tests takes a few seconds to finish. All of the specs should pass locally, and you should see that also reflected on IronBoard, but these specs will not pass for the remote build on IronBoard: basically you should just see two green lights on IronBoard and that's okay.

Next:

* Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
* Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
* Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from).
